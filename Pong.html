                            <h1><strong>About</strong> of this project.</h1>
                            <p>The game relies on the Abstract Window Toolkit API. 
                                <strong>Java.AWT</strong> provides classes that aid in creating an applet.
                            </p>
                            <h1></h1>
                            <p>In order to keep the ball within the GUI, I used the 
                                <strong>
                                    intersects()
                                </strong> method. This method returns a boolean value based
                                 on if two rectangles are in the same parameters.
                            </p>
                            <h1></h1>
                            <p>When intersects() is true, the Ball class is passed new X & Y values
                                 and this reverses the direction of the ball like a bounce. Every bounce
                                  slightly increases the speed of the ball.</p>

                                <h3>When you look at the game you might notice a few shapes that represent
                                    in game objects. By extending the Rectangle class that is in the Abstract Window Toolkit I was able to create these shapes.
                                     The paddles inherit features of the Rectangle class to make a 2d rectangle object. Instead of making
                                      two paddle classes from scratch I predefined the paddle parameters and made two different paddles using a unique
                                       "id" parameter.

                                    <h3> This was my first time using event/action listeners to make objects responsive. I needed an eventListener that corresponded
                                          to the paddle id so that there can be two different player keybinds. The solution was a switch statement. When paddleX.keyPressed()
                                           was called this switch statement behaved based off the id being passed.

                                    <h3> For any game to be fun it has to be fast enough to run smoothly. This game has a method called <i>run</i> that contains an infinite loop.
                                         Within the infinite loop there are a few AWT methods that keep the game moving: move(), checkCollision(), and repaint().
                                          The problem that many people encounter with high performance java GUI's is that the infinite loop is not fast enough and the GUI becomes choppy.
                                           To fix this problem I had to research the java System.nanoTime() method. To speed up this infinite loop, the game uses a fixed timestep
                                            and interpolates between frames to provide smooth animation for the players. (around 60hz)
